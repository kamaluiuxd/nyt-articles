(Enchanted Lion, $34.95.) This collection of letters from famous writers addressing their love of books (along with illustrations by the likes of Maira Kalman, Chris Ware, Roz Chast and many, many others) is an embarrassment of riches. HOW TO DATE MEN WHEN YOU HATE MEN By Blythe Roberson. (Flatiron, $19.99.) How do you reconcile your anger with the patriarchy when you’re also attracted to men? With biting wit, Roberson explores the dynamics of heterosexual dating in the age of #MeToo. ON THOMAS MERTON By Mary Gordon. (Shambala, $24.95.) Thomas Merton was one of the most important Catholic thinkers of the 20th century, a writer and a monk who found a way to balance these two identities. Gordon, an acclaimed novelist, unpacks his legacy. THE BANISHED IMMORTAL By Ha Jin. (Pantheon, $28.) The National Book Award-winning author of “Waiting” turns to biography to tell the story of Li Bai, the eighth-century Chinese poet, shaped by Taoist thought, who continues to be read in China today. SERIOUSLY CURIOUS Edited by Tom Standage. (The Economist/PublicAffairs, paper, $17.99.) Standage, the deputy editor of The Economist, has culled some quirky questions from two of the magazine’s explainer blogs.
